This work was done in Summer-2020 and has been uploaded recently on github. 
A repository of all Deep Learning projects done by me. These projects have helped me understand 
the dynamics of Deep learning. They are not my innovations, and you may find similar work elsewhere. 
I have not been in touch with these projects owing to my research work. 

Pl. feel free to contribute or ping me up on neminbshah@gmail.com for further correspondence. 
Have a nice day!
